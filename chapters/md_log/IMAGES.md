- ‚úÖ SDXL running

# Jan - Feb 2025
- ‚úÖ switched to FLUX shnell because Milli found it has better image quality

# Apr - May 2025
- ‚úÖ switched to FLUX dev because IPAdapter doesn't work with shnell
- ‚úÖ implemented IPAdapter into AHS system
- ‚û°Ô∏è IPAdapter issues:
    - the backgrounds are carried over. we want to make fresh backgrounds when we choose.
    - 2+ characters in image, both characters end up resembling if they're the same sex.
- ‚û°Ô∏è low-hanging fruit from Redmond...
    - garbled text in images
    - image emotion should match the paragraph emotion. perhaps on the last sentence.

- üí° have people act as T2I models: gen the story, then give people to visualise it using simple digital collaging / mosaicing / cutout style. they select a patient, the clothing, the location/bg, the HP, etc. then we compare with what the T2I generated.
