# Sep - Dec 2024
- ✅ SDXL running

# Jan - Feb 2025
- ✅ switched to FLUX shnell because Milli found it has better image quality

# Apr - May 2025
- ✅ switched to FLUX dev because IPAdapter doesn't work with shnell
- ✅ implemented IPAdapter into AHS system
- ➡️ IPAdapter issues:
    - the backgrounds are carried over. we want to make fresh backgrounds when we choose.
    - 2+ characters in image, both characters end up resembling if they're the same sex.
- ➡️ low-hanging fruit from Redmond...
    - garbled text in images
    - image emotion should match the paragraph emotion. perhaps on the last sentence.
