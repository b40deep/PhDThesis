# Sep - Dec 2024
- ✅ started off with `TheBloke/dolphin-2.2.1-mistral-7B-GGUF/dolphin-2.2.1-mistral-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf`

# Jan - Feb 2025
- ✅ switched to `gpt-4o-mini` via azure openai because it has better quality
- ✅ reworked the story prompt in the pattern of external and internal motivations. 
 - it starts off with external motivation to change e.g., failing at work due to health => go to healthcare professional HP.
 - then HP gives external instruction e.g., walk 10 minutes a day.
 - as the Px practices these, he or she sees the benefit. this builds the internal motivation
 - then the _reason behind the HP's external instruction_ becomes the internal instruction

# Apr - May 2025
- ✅ switched story prompt to match Gabi's new form structure
