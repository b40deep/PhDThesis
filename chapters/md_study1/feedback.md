# current questions
- how many testers? how to get that number aside from guessing.
- after gathering user and LLM 6C feedback, how do I do the comparison?
    - LLMs can give us ratings on which is better: we can run this through the LLM generating the story and other StoryEval LLMs. Add DeltaScore for fine-grained evaluations.
    - Then we show these results to the user and the accompanying explanations, and they agree/disagree with reasons. similar to COEVAL but better.
- how do I do the user experience testing? find some questionnaires.
    - they are mannyyyyy!
    - for now, we'll use these from Mirowski et al.:
        - Helpfulness: I found the AI system helpful.
        - Collaboration: I felt like I was collaborating with the AI system.
        - Ease: I found it easy to write with the AI system.
        - Enjoyment: I enjoyed writing with the AI system.
        - Expression: I was able to express my creative goals while writing with the AI system.
        - Unique: The script(s) written with the AI system feel unique.
        - Ownership: I feel I have ownership over the created script(s).
        - Surprise: I was surprised by the responses from the AI system.

Questions:
- Two separate versions of the app?
- Share my ideas with them or keep separate?
Ask what the pipeline is. I give them and they give me. Try and get an agreement and see if you get something back. Could it be a chapter? Is there a way to incorporate it into the PhD? Or get your name on a paper? 

I should be on the Sept paper.
