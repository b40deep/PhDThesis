abstract = {This paper presents a community-centered study of cultural limitations of text-to-image (T2I) models in the South Asian context. We theorize these failures using scholarship on dominant media regimes of representations and locate them within participants’ reporting of their existing social marginalizations. We thus show how generative AI can reproduce an outsiders gaze for viewing South Asian cultures, shaped by global and regional power inequities. By centering communities as experts and soliciting their perspectives on T2I limitations, our study adds rich nuance into existing evaluative frameworks and deepens our understanding of the culturally-specific ways AI technologies can fail in non-Western and Global South settings. We distill lessons for responsible development of T2I models, recommending concrete pathways forward that can allow for recognition of structural inequalities.},

ABSTRACT = {Generating automatic visualization from natural language texts is an important task for promoting language learning and literacy development for young children and language learners. However, translating a text into a coherent visualization matching its relevant keywords is a challenging problem. To tackle this issue, we proposed a robust story visualization pipeline ranging from NLP and relation extraction to image sequence generation and alignment. First, we applied a shallow semantic representation of the text where we extracted concepts including relevant characters, scene objects, and events in an appropriate format. We also distinguished between simple and complex actions. This distinction helped to realize an optimal visualization of the scene objects and their relationships according to the target audience. Second, we utilized an image generation framework along with different versions to support the visualization task efficiently. Third, we used CLIP similarity function as a semantic relevance metric to check local and global coherence to the whole story. Finally, we validated the scene sequence to compose a final visualization using the different versions for various target audiences. Our preliminary results showed considerable effectiveness in adopting such a pipeline for a coarse visualization task that can subsequently be enhanced.},

    abstract = "Multilingual pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on several downstream tasks for both high-resourced and low-resourced languages. However, there is still a large performance drop for languages unseen during pre-training, especially African languages. One of the most effective approaches to adapt to a new language is language adaptive fine-tuning (LAFT) {---} fine-tuning a multilingual PLM on monolingual texts of a language using the pre-training objective. However, adapting to target language individually takes large disk space and limits the cross-lingual transfer abilities of the resulting models because they have been specialized for a single language. In this paper, we perform multilingual adaptive fine-tuning on 17 most-resourced African languages and three other high-resource languages widely spoken on the African continent to encourage cross-lingual transfer learning. To further specialize the multilingual PLM, we removed vocabulary tokens from the embedding layer that corresponds to non-African writing scripts before MAFT, thus reducing the model size by around 50{\%}. Our evaluation on two multilingual PLMs (AfriBERTa and XLM-R) and three NLP tasks (NER, news topic classification, and sentiment classification) shows that our approach is competitive to applying LAFT on individual languages while requiring significantly less disk space. Additionally, we show that our adapted PLM also improves the zero-shot cross-lingual transfer abilities of parameter efficient fine-tuning methods.",
