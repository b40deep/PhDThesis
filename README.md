This repository contains a thesis template implemented in LaTeX based on [that of the Computer Vision group](https://github.com/CS-Swansea/Computer-Vision-and-Machine-Learning-Wiki/tree/master/thesis-templates).
It contains examples of various standard sections and good practices, and should help you get started with writing a high-quality dissertation/thesis in LaTeX.

- I'm using this as a temprary storage for literature i'm reading. 
- I've made a backup of the original `thesis.tex` file so you can access it when the time comes to write in proper order.
- I've switched from the `tex` method to the `md` method for speed.
